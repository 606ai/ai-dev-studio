## Database Setup

This project uses MongoDB as its primary database. Follow these steps to set up the database:

1. Install MongoDB:
   - Download and install MongoDB Community Server from [MongoDB Download Center](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)
   - Or use Docker:
     ```bash
     docker run -d -p 27017:27017 --name ai-dev-studio-db mongo:latest
     ```

2. Configure Environment Variables:
   - Copy `.env.template` to `.env`
   - Update the MongoDB connection string if needed
   - Set your JWT secret key

3. Database Connection:
   - The application will automatically connect to MongoDB on startup
   - Default local connection: `mongodb://localhost:27017/ai-dev-studio`
   - For production, set `MONGODB_URI` in your environment variables

4. Data Models:
   - Users: Stores user information and authentication
   - Projects: Stores project data and metadata
   - Additional models will be added as needed

5. Backup and Restore:
   ```bash
   # Backup
   mongodump --db ai-dev-studio --out ./backup

   # Restore
   mongorestore --db ai-dev-studio ./backup/ai-dev-studio
   ```
